Description:
Using biometric sensor data, identify variables strongly correlated with emotional state. Once the strongest candidates have been uncovered, develop a classification model to predict emotional state when no label data is available.

Summary of Questions:
How do we identify an emotional state like stress preemptively, as to alert a user that they may be approaching a stressed state, and corrective action should be taken? 

How effective of an indicator can respiration, and/or body temperature, be in classifying a subjects emotional state? 

Applications:
This type of model has applications in several domain and could be used almost anywhere. A few of the ‘applications’ were more geared towards the product design perspective, “If we were going to build a product like this, how could we use our findings to build the *best* product”. An example of this would be: The EDA portion of this study could be applied to hardware design and sensor specifications. We were working with data collected at 70hz. The definition was very high and could likely be decreased considerably. This would impact the energy and computational resource requirements for any biofeedback hardware (some wearable device).  

This type of classification could be applied to wearable devices that would alert a user whether or not they are stressed, or inform them once they have reached a state of relaxation. From another perspective, collecting emotional state feedback about some environment or situation. A product similar to what we have put together could be applied to design settings to test the response of participants. Such as, designing workspaces that maintain stress to a minimum, or entertainment spaces to optimize for amusement.
